# About

ChatKeke-Framework is a comprehensive chatbot platform offering users a dynamic and interactive conversation experience. Designed with a focus on regional users (such as within a country, etc), but is also versatile for broader audiences, it combines a sleek frontend with a robust backend, integrating seamlessly with OpenAI's GPT models or any local LLM of your own choosing.

ChatKeke's core idea is to provide a low-barrier of entry AI that is accessible to almost everyone within a given region that the framework is intended for. This locality enables the chatbot's functionalities to be better primed and aligned for user interests within given region.

# Features

- The backend can also be modified to use any local LLM as the "brains" for the chat interface.
- OpenAI API function call capabilities: use online search engines, fetch and display news from multiple sources ranging from RSS feeds to web sources.
